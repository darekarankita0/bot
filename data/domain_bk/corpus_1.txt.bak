What does Industry Data represent? Industry Data represents aggregated data from all the loans flowing through all Encompass clients. All test loans are excluded.
What does Restricted Data mean? Ellie Mae Insights ensure anonymity of lendersâ€™ data. We follow a 5-30 rule to maintain anonymity. This means that for any given data point for industry and peer group data, we will not display information unless that data point has data representing at least 5 lenders and none of the lenders have over 30% market share for that data point.
What does No Data mean? Insights does not have any loans to represent that metric.
